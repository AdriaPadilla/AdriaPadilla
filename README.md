### Hi! 👋

My name is **Adrian**, I am a professor and researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 

Specialized in data extraction and analysis with Python, oriented to the field of social sciences. I am especially interested in everything related to digital platforms, social networks and web pages, which are a source of information on human behavior and social relationships.
